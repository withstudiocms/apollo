DISCORD_APP_TOKEN=...
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=...

# Turso ENVs. You have to create a Turso DB to get these.
TURSO_URL=libsql://...
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=...

# GitHub App Information. 
GITHUB_APP_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_USERNAME_OR_ORG=...
GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID=... # This has to be retrieved manually
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY="
